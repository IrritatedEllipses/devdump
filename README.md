## What is the Daily Dev Dump

Daily Dev Dump is currently a daily thread on the Shacknews Chatty ( <http://www.shacknews.com/chatty> ) where Developers of all types can come together to ask questions, talk about their developer experiences, discuss current events in the development world, and learn from each other. Dev Dump is an all inclusive discussion for developers of all skill levels, whether retired from a life long career of creating or merely just interested in making "Hello, World!" appear on the screen for the very first time.

The completely misnamed Daily Dev Dump is posted most weekdays and usually at least once on the weekend.

## What is this repository

Currently this repository holds an archive of the Daily Dev Dump as posted by user TotalFusionOne starting from June 4th, 2018. The repository also holds a Dev Dump Design Rules file that serves as a mock up / example of documentation to be used for future projects. 

## What are the future plans for this repository

The Daily Dev Dump is posted in a format that should be easily parsed by simple JavaScript. Considering this fact making a stand alone one page app with React should be an easy task to accomplish, especially for some one who is angling for a project of their very own, much like me.

## Can I help contribute

As of right now there is no need to contribute to this repository as it serves as just an archive and a starting point for future plans. This situation may change as more plans are developed. The best way for you to contribute to the Daily Dev Dump is to join the Shacknews Community - a fantastic bedrock of video game journalism - at <http://www.shacknews.com>, and join in with the rest of the participants in the Daily Dev Dump.

Feel free to fork or star this repository and otherwise use it for your own needs in the meantime. More information will be forthcoming.
