This quick read resonated with me so hard. I've been struggling to consider myself a developer for almost five months now and never quite felt ready to undertake my own projects that I thought of, researched, and worked on completely on my own. But I would do tutorial after tutorial, watch screen cast after screen cast, and work on my webpage endlessly without actually finishing anything I'd done on my own. The answer is really a simple one, and one people here on the chatty have said many, many times: Just do it. Just start. Go. Actually, don't even finish reading Dev Dump. If you're new to developing quit reading now and start doing something.
