### YAML: Probably not so great after all

<https://arp242.net/weblog/yaml_probably_not_so_great_after_all.html>

Thanks to jcupitt. They posted this late last night and I wanted to make sure people saw it. I don't have much experience with YAML at all as of yet but this was a pretty interesting look at problems you might face when using it. My first thought is "Holy python, that is a huge spec." My second one is why would anyone not quote strings?

### Learning Go's Conurrency Through Illustrations

<https://medium.com/@trevor4e/learning-gos-concurrency-through-illustrations-8c4aff603b3>

I don't know why but I find myself looking at Go a lot more lately. It just seems like a simple and readable. What do you all use Go for? I'm about a third of a way through my JS / Ruby / Rails / PostGRE coursework so I won't be doing anything with it anytime soon but I'm kind of looking forward to it.

### Hola JS Summer Challenge 2018: Haggling

<https://github.com/hola/challenge_haggling>

First place: $3000
Second place: $2000
Third place: $1000

This seems like an interesting challenge! I wish I knew enough to get started on it right now. I did not know that Hola was sponsoring coding contests but it's neat to see! I wonder how many of the submissions will be viewable. Anyone thinking about entering?
