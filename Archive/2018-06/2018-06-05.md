### Five quick thoughts on Microsoft + GitHub

Pretty rosy musings all and all, I love the idea of Microsoft nurturing programmers from Minecraft to LinkedIn.

<https://hackernoon.com/things-you-should-never-say-when-interviewing-for-a-developer-role-138609321d7b>

These are things people actually do in interviews? I can't imagine not having any questions for the interviewer and the idea of showing up to an interview and just saying "No, I'm not going to do that" boggles my mind.

### Demystifying CORS

Finally. Thank you. A nice write up on what the hell the CORS error I get for certain sites is. Most of the time I just know it's "That thing where I have to run that special extension I never use."

## g{A few notes on Dev Dump}g

I've decided that, in order to hold myself accountable and stick to a daily schedule, I'm going to start uploading the main portion of Dev Dump to a GitHub repo (Because I'm a dirty, dirty Microsoft Shill as I was lovingly told). Eventually that repo will be hosted into a GitHub page where I can have it displayed nicely, not to mention if for some reason you wanted to have a local copy of all of this you'd be able to fork it at any time.

This whole Dev Dump idea is a totally selfish endeveour, tapping into your knowledge so that I can further myself, and I thank you all for it. Reading these threads has become a source of daily joy for me.
