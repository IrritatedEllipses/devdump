### Meet the GitLab Web IDE

<https://about.gitlab.com/2018/06/15/introducing-gitlab-s-integrated-development-environment/>

Man, GitLab is on a PR tear this month with obvious reasons but this is pretty cool. Maybe not so much the Web IDE (I haven't touched it yet, nor used anything on GitLab) but the story behind it and how they're giving props to one of their staffers.

### Strapdown.js

Uh. Yeah. Easy drop-in Markdown files in HTML that are theme-able with bootstrap templates without server side compilation. I'm going to have to check what performance hit using the script takes but I'm seeing "Really, really simple CMS for blogs" written all over this.

### Learn CSS Layout

<http://learnlayout.com/>

I used to put a whole bunch of things that helped me on my learning path in here and I feel like I've been neglecting that lately. This is an awesome walk through that takes you... ~20 minutes and goes through a lot of CSS layout material. It's great for just learning CSS or needing a bit of a refresher on small topics you may have forgotten.
