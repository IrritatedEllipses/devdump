### Dev.Tube

<https://dev.tube/>

Well. That ends my search for lectures to put on while leveling. Dev.Tube just finds developer talks on YouTube and makes them searchable, layed out cleanly, and ready to consume. I ended up watching three videos while I was supposed to be writing this description. Now I'm an expert at MongoDB.
