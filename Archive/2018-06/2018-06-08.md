It's Friday and I've put in 30 hours of working on a project so today we're just going to watch videos while I nurse a code hangover. 

### Wes Bos' CSS Grid full course now available on YouTube

I've really enjoyed every course I've taken from Wes Bos. His JavaScript 30 course is a must do after you learn basic terminology in JavaScript and I still go back and run through his cardio lessons whenever I don't know what I should be doing. Since we had a question about CSS Grid the other day I thought I'd post this up.

JSEU conference. It's really nice to hear the creator of a major piece of software talk about what they wish they'd do differently. Ryan Dahl is a bit more gregarious than I would have thought and it's a pretty good listen. Not to mention it gave me a really good surface understanding of what's going on inside NodeJS.

I've not even started learning much about the backend except some basic rails things. I wanted to put this video on here because I'm honestly not sure if this is... Well, legit. Secure. Since I'm stealing knowledge from you folks anyway I figured I'd leave it here and watch the discussion take place.
