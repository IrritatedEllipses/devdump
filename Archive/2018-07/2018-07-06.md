### Ruby for Beginners

<http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/index.html>

I'm starting working with Ruby and I'm kinda surprised how much easier it is to pick up than I thought it'd be. I think I have to thank my months of working with JavaScript. This is a quick beginners guide that I used along side the next link to cement a few concepts in my mind. This is the more "doc-esque" version of the two so, if you don't learn through conversation, this is the one you'll want to read.

### Learn to Program (Ruby)

<https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/>

The Pragmatic Programmers "Learn to Program" is available for free through the authors website. I tore through nine chapters yesterday messing around with all the exercises put into it and, I gotta say, the way the information is presented really helped me learn. I feel like I learn better through similes and this book has those in spades.

### Visual Studios Code June '18 update

Uhhh that Grid editor layout is awesome. Also, portable mode is going to be a must for my keyring usb drive. I'm a little curious about the Flask Tutorial though, are they going to be bundling in tutorials for frameworks and languages into VS Code? Seems a little odd, but it's a welcome addition. I'd rather they were downloadable extensions though.
