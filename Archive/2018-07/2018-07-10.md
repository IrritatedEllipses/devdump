### Which Hashing Algorithm is Best for Uniqueness and Speed

<https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/49550/which-hashing-algorithm-is-best-for-uniqueness-and-speed>

### Ruby Koans

<http://rubykoans.com/>

I have a personal roadmap to learning each section on The Odin Project and this has been added to the end of my Ruby section. A collection of "meditative" exercises to help cement Ruby knowledge in your brain. Since TryRuby and Rails for Zombies have both been taken over by PluralSight there hasn't been many good free resources for Ruby left out there. Hopefully this picks up the slack for me.
