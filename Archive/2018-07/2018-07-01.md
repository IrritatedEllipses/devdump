### XVideos NodeJS API library

<https://github.com/rodrigogs/xvideos>

NSFW maybe? There are no pictures but here is the XVideos NodeJS library. There is a reddit thread in /r/programming that's going through it and finding errors but it doesn't seem like anyone wants to submit a pull request. I personally liked:

/{{
    if (page < 1 && page > Number.MAX_VALUE) {
    throw new Error(`Invalid page: ${page}`);
  }
  }}/
